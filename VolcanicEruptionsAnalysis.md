# Volcanic Eruptions Analysis

This notebook will look into data from a 238 volcanic eruptions from over the course of 2,500 years.

## Reading the Data into Notebook

Always begin a new set of r with the library(tidyverse) code, as well and the data packages, which are pasted below.

Begin each new session by running the tidyverse and the package of interest.

:::


We have specified eruptions (in the initial_split function), so that is the data which will be available. By changing this to one of the other five available data sets in the initial load, we can view different data.

By running exploratory_data, the table below is generated.

## Interesting Questions to Ask

-   What is the name of the volcano with the largest number of eruptions?

-   What percent of the total eruptions were confirmed vs. unconfirmed?

-   What are all different evidence methods and how many times were each of them used?

-   Are volcanic eruptions more likely to happen in one area of the globe?

## Data Exploration

This uses the skim function to summarize data, by skimming the "evidence_method_dating" column we can see that there are 5589 rows, which should correspond to 5589 individual tracked eruptions. There are 15 columns, which could correspond to 15 different methods of evidence dating. This function does not show each of the names of the data collection methods.


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
exploratory_data %>%
  count(eruption_category)
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
```
# A tibble: 3 × 2
  eruption_category        n
  <chr>                <int>
1 Confirmed Eruption    4960
2 Discredited Eruption    83
3 Uncertain Eruption     546
```
:::
:::


This function shows us how many of each eruption category are tracked in this data set. There appear to be 4,964 confirmed eruptions, 80 discredited eruptions, and 545 uncertain eruptions. This could be useful data because in determining answers to questions about actual eruptions, it may be necessary to only look at the 4,964 eruptions which were confirmed.

This counts the eruptions per individual volcano. By using the arrange function, we are able to change the way that the data is presented and organize it in descending order, so that the volcano with the most eruptions is listed first. This shows us that volcano number 211060 has erupted the most times (124). Because this is so much more than any of the others, it can be considered an out liar and could be worth investigating more.

  count(eruption_category) %>%
  arrange(-n)

10 Merapi                 Confirmed Eruption    49
# … with 1,015 more rows
```
:::
:::


By running the code above we are able to see which volcanoes have the highest number of confirmed eruptions. It is evident that Etna has 100 confirmed eruptions, but there are at least 10 other volcanoes which have more than 50 confirmed eruptions.

## Hypotheses

-   I hypothesize that volcanoes with the highest number of confirmed eruptions do not all exist in one region of the world.

-   I hypothesize that the most common method of evidence dating is Historical Observations.

## Proving Hypotheses

-   The first hypothesis can be proved with the code block above. Using ggplot, we are able to place the ten volcanoes with the highest recorded amounts of confirmed eruptions on a topographic map. We are able to see that the volcanoes are located across the map, not just in one region. Of the top ten, there are none existing in North America. There appear to be three of the top ten located in the far eastern Asia/Japan region, and another in the Indonesia. Based on this data we may be able to make inferences about where some of the most active volcanoes in the world are located.

-   The second hypothesis is examined in the code block below. It is evident that of the 20 different methods of evidence dating, historical observation is the most commonly used. However, it is worth noting that Radiocarbon and Tephrochronology were used a significant number of times as well, accounting for a total of 1436 out of 4964 total confirmed eruptions, or 29%. Additionally, 626 out of 496 confirmed eruptions (13%) have an unknown method, which could also be noted for significance.
