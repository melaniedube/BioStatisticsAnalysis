<section id="abstract" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This notebook examines data from a number of volcanic eruptions over the course of 2,500 years. There are a number of questions which can be generated from this data, including which volcano has the most eruptions, what region of the world has the most active volcanoes, and what was the longest confirmed eruption.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>There are 5,589 total volcanoes which were have been added to this data set thus far. The observed volcanoes are located across the world, spanning all seven continents. There are a variety of classifications which volcanoes can fall into, including active, dormant, and extinct. The exploratory function for this set allows access to many different categories of data. The name and identification numbers (including eruption number and volcano number) for each volcano are listed, as well as eruption category. Additional data about the start and end dates of each eruption, and physical location of the volcano are also tracked in the data table.</p>

<p>This uses the skim function to summarize data, by skimming the “evidence_method_dating” column we can see that there are 5589 rows, which should correspond to 5589 individual tracked eruptions. There are 15 columns, which could correspond to 15 different methods of evidence dating. This function does not show each of the names of the data collection methods.</p>

<p>This function shows us how many of each eruption category are tracked in this data set. There appear to be 4,964 confirmed eruptions, 80 discredited eruptions, and 545 uncertain eruptions. This could be useful data because in determining answers to questions about actual eruptions, it may be necessary to only look at the 4,964 eruptions which were confirmed.</p>

<p>This counts the eruptions per individual volcano. By using the arrange function, we are able to change the way that the data is presented and organize it in descending order, so that the volcano with the most eruptions is listed first. This shows us that volcano number 211060 has erupted the most times (124). Because this is so much more than any of the others, it can be considered an out liar and could be worth investigating more.</p>

<p>By running the code above we are able to see which volcanoes have the highest number of confirmed eruptions. It is evident that Etna has 100 confirmed eruptions, but there are at least 10 other volcanoes which have more than 50 confirmed eruptions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first hypothesis can be tested with the code block above. Using ggplot, we are able to place the ten volcanoes with the highest recorded number of confirmed eruptions on a topographic map. We are able to see that the volcanoes are located across the map, not just in one region. Of the top ten, there are none existing in North America. There appear to be three of the top ten located in the far eastern Asia/Japan region, and another in the Indonesia.</p></li>
<li><p>The second hypothesis is examined in the code block below. It is evident that of the 20 different methods of evidence dating, historical observation is the most commonly used. However, it is worth noting that Radiocarbon and Tephrochronology were used a significant number of times as well, accounting for a total of 1436 out of 4964 total confirmed eruptions, or 29%. Additionally, 626 out of 496 confirmed eruptions (13%) have an unknown method, which could also be noted for significance.</p></li>

<p>The block above takes data for latitude and longitude and combines them to determine the region of the world where the volcano is located. The mutate function helps determine whether the volcano is north/south or east/west, and the unite function takes created columns for these two variables and combines them into one called “region”, where each volcano can be categorized into one of four different regions, north-east, north-west, south-east, or south-west.</p>

<p>The plot above shows each of the regions of the world and the corresponding volcanoes which have been studied in each region. Using this plot we are able to see that the south-west appears to be the least “active” region in terms of volcanic eruptions, while the north eastern region is the most active. In general, there appear to be significantly more eruptions in the north compared to the south.</p>

<p>This testing method allows to determine the likelihood of one dating method to be used compared to all others. The null hypothesis we have created is that all evidence method dating types are equally likely. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis would be that all the evidence method dating types are not equally likely. Through a chi-square goodness of fit test, we can compare the observed distribution to an expected distribution. Running this test with the data calculated an extremely small p value (2.2e-16), which leads us to believe that the alternative hypothesis is correct and not all methods are equally likely to be used.</p>

<p>The volcanic eruptions data set allows for many different tests and analyses of volcanic activity of the past. Based on this data researchers may be able to make inferences about where some of the most active volcanoes in the world are located. By running tests on both the experimental and tests data, scientists are able to make predictions about future volcanic activity, which could have a severe impact on human society and all life on the earth.</p>
